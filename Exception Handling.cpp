/* try: represents a block of code that can throw an exception.

catch: represents a block of code that is executed when a particular exception is thrown.

throw: Used to throw an exception. Also used to list the exceptions that a function throws, but doesnâ€™t handle itself.*/


// Simple Code for Exception Handling using try-catch block.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

    int x = -1;
    cout << "Before try \n";
    try{
        cout << "Inside try \n";
        if (x < 0){
